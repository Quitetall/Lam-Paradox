Logic:
I was curious on the nature of AI intelligence and it's inability to solve certain deep problems not in it's training data. I started with a dichotomy between AI running into memory constraints or not and simply not being able to produce more than just permutations of the logic embedded into itâ€™s training data. Using this, I was curious into the limitations of AI only being able to touch permutations of training data, and came to the lam paradox.
